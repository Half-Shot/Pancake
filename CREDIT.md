Thanks a lot to:
	PixelLab for their awesome PxLoader. I don't think this will be the last thing i will use from them.
	MrDoob for Three.js for having one of the best WebGL libs out there. Keep up the good work.
	JQuery team for making javascript much cleaner.
 	The Arch Linux Team, for the best possible operating system to develop on. Even if the setup is a pain in the arse.
 	RequireJS for allowing me to add a module system.
