###NOTE: This document reflects future plans atm as the development is not finished. The usage /should/ stay very simular though.

##Folders:
		/js				Contains the source code for Pancake. In here you shouldn't edit the files by default, but it should be commented so if you wish. 
		/js/libs 		Contains the libs such as JQuery, Three.js and PxLoader.
		/js/config	Contains configuration files for Pancake
			*CGraphics.js 	Setting such as window width, height and camera movement systems.
			*CLoader.js		Important, contains reference to each file needed by the game.
			*Config.js 			Anything else that does not fit those categorys.
			
		/images					Its wise to put any file
