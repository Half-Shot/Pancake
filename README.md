A flat framework for HTML5 Games. It is designed for use with my future WebGL Experiments.

###Notes:

The framework has come far these past few days. I still do not reccomend using it yet but you can scan through it and see if its for you.
Also i think its a safe bet to have a look at the module system since thats not going to change.

I welcome any help with this. If you have three.js/html5 audio api experience thats a great bonus.
Also any optimisations you think it could do with your probably right, i just don't have time to write them myself at the moment.
